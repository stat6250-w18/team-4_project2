title1
'Research Question: What are the top five schools that experienced the biggest increase in "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" between AY2014-15 and AY2015-16?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This should help identify schools to consider for new outreach based upon increasing child-poverty levels.'
;

footnote1
"Of the five schools with the greatest increases in percent eligible for free/reduced-price meals between AY2014-15 and AY2015-16, the increase in percent eligible ranges from about 41% to about 55%."
;

footnote2
"Given the magnitude of these changes, further investigation should be performed to ensure no data errors are involved."
;

footnote3
"However, assuming there are no data issues underlying this analysis, possible explanations for such large increases include changing CA demographics and recent loosening of the rules under which students qualify for free/reduced-price meals."
;

*
Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column of the same name from frpm1516.

Methodology: When combining frpm1415 with frpm1516 during data preparation,
take the difference of values of "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" for each
school and create a new variable called frpm_rate_change_2014_to_2015. Then,
use proc sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending by
frpm_rate_change_2014_to_2015. Finally, use proc print here to display the
first five rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for schools with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for percentages
between 0 and 1.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data, e.g., by using a previous year's
data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

*******************************************************************************;

title1
'Research Question: Can "Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)" be used to predict the proportion of high school graduates earning a combined score of at least 1500 on the SAT?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This would help inform whether child-poverty levels are associated with college-preparedness rates, providing a strong indicator for the types of schools most in need of college-preparation outreach.'
;

footnote1
"As can be seen, there was an extremely high correlation between student poverty and SAT scores in AY2014-15, with lower-poverty schools much more likely to have high proportions of students with combined SAT scores exceeding 1500."
;

footnote2
"Possible explanations for this correlation include child-poverty rates tending to be higher at schools with lower overall academic performance and quality of instruction. In addition, students in non-poverish conditions are more likely to have parents able to pay for SAT preparation."
;

footnote3
"Given this apparent correlation based on descriptive methodology, further investigation should be performed using inferential methodology to determine the level of statistical significance of the result."
;

*
Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column PCTGE1500 from sat15.

Methodology: Use proc means to compute 5-number summaries of "Percent (%)
Eligible Free (K-12)" and PCTGE1500. Then use proc format to create formats
that bin both columns with respect to the proc means output. Then use proc freq
to create a cross-tab of the two variables with respect to the created formats.

Limitations: Even though predictive modeling is specified in the research
questions, this methodology solely relies on a crude descriptive technique
by looking at correlations along quartile values, which could be too coarse a
method to find actual association between the variables.

Followup Steps: A possible follow-up to this approach could use an inferential
statistical technique like linear regression.

title1
'Research Question: What are the top ten schools were the number of high school graduates taking the SAT exceeds the number of high school graduates completing UC/CSU entrance requirements?'
;

title2
"Rationale: This would help identify schools with significant gaps in preparation specific for California's two public university systems, suggesting where focused outreach on UC/CSU college-preparation might have the greatest impact."
;

footnote1
"All ten schools listed appear to have extremely large numbers of 12th-graders graduating who have completed the SAT but not the coursework needed to apply for the UC/CSU system"
;

footnote2
"Given the magnitude of these numbers, further investigation should be performed to ensure no data errors are involved."
;

footnote3
"However, assuming there are no data issues underlying this analysis, possible explanations for such large numbers of 12th-graders completing only the SAT include lack of access to UC/CSU-preparatory coursework, as well as lack of proper counseling for students early enough in high school to complete all necessary coursework."

Note: This compares the column NUMTSTTAKR from sat15 to the column TOTAL from
gradaf15.

Methodology: When combining sat15 and gradaf15 during data preparation, take
the difference between NUMTSTTAKR in sat15 and TOTAL in gradaf15 for each
school and create a new variable called excess_sat_takers. Then, use proc sort
to create a temporary sorted table in descending by excess_sat_takers. Finally,
use proc print here to display the first 10 rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for schools with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for values
outside of admissable values.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean the values of variables so that the
statistics computed do not include any possible illegal values, and better
handle missing data, e.g., by using a previous year's data or a rolling average
of previous years' data as a proxy.
